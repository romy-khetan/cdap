/**
 * Optimization for CDAP-7021.
 *
 * We cache appmaster and container jars created by twill the first time a program
 * of that type is run. However, if 100 programs are started at the same time, all 100 will still create those
 * jars since the cached jars won't be available at run start. So as an optimization, if a program is
 * launching and its cached jars are not available, and its not the first program of its type to be launched,
 * and its launching within 2 minutes of the first run, wait for the cache jars to become available.
 * without this, we might actually miss schedule runs due to jar building taking too much time and resources.
